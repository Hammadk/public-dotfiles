This is a copy of Hammad's dotfiles. Running `home/bootstrap.sh` creates new symlinks in the `$HOME` folder for all files and folders in `/home`. Files and folders that you wish to symlink must start with a `.`

### Usage:

``` sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Hammadk/dotFiles.git
cd dotFiles
sh bootstrap.sh
```

Once `bootstrap.sh` is run, you'll see output that looks like:
``` sh
-e ~/.inputrc does not exist. Symlinking to dotfile.
-e ~/.irbrc is symlinked to your dotfiles.
-e ~/.tmux-mac.conf is symlinked to your dotfiles.
```

Mac Requirement:

``` sh
brew install tmux
brew install reattach-to-user-namespace # needed for Tmux

# Dependency for AG
brew install the_silver_searcher

# Fuzzy search for vim
brew install fzf
```

```
1. Install Terminal themes in dotfiles/themes
2. Install Fonts from dotfiles/fonts
```
